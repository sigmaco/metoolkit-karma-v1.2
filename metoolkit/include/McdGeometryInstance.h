    The geometry instance object utility functions

    Geometry Instances track instances of (possibly) shared geometries within Mcd

    You can query geometrical properties of an isolated McdGeometryInstance object
    using the McdGeometryInstance interface, which uses the McdGeometry
    protocol and takes into account its transformation matrix.
