/****************************************************************************
  These are the structures used to store a convex hull.

  Separate functions are provided to measure/allocate/populate the hull
  so that you can use any allocation method (such as alloca).
  
  This data allows you to easily traverse the convex hull using a hill 
  climbing algorithm, either by walking adjacent faces, or walking 
  adjacent vertices.  Each face points to a list of edges which are sorted
  in anti-clockwise order around the face.  Also each vertex points to 
  a list of edges which are sorted ACW around the vertex.  The list of
  all edges stores every edge two times (one each direction).  Every edge
  indicates its two end points and the face on its right side.  If you want
  to look at every edge once only, then you can ignore the backward
  edges, for instance, fromVert < toVert.
  
  The edges are sorted in anti-clockwise order around each face.
  To access the edges sorted in anti-clockwise order around a vertex, you go
  through the "edgeIndex" array.  For example,

    //  every edge/face/vertex around a vertex in ACW order

    for (i=cnv.vertex[a].firstEdgeIndex; i<cnv.vertex[a+1].firstEdgeIndex; ++i)
    {
        cout << cnv.edge[cnv.edgeIndex[i]].rightFace;
        cout << cnv.edge[cnv.edgeIndex[i]].toVert;
    }

    //  every edge/face/vertex around a face in ACW order

    for (i=cnv.face[a].firstEdge; i<cnv.face[a+1].firstEdge; ++i)
    {
        cout << cnv.edge[i].rightFace;
        cout << cnv.edge[i].fromVert;
    }

  For convenience, the last face/vertex in each list is a sentinel 
  in which firstEdge=numEdges.
