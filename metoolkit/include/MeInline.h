 *  Inlining control. If you want to use inlining in a public header, include
 *  this file and write "#define MePUT_FUNCTIONS_HERE_IF_NOT_INLINED 1" in the
 *  source file that includes the header.
 *
 *  Usage in the header that contains inlines is:
 *
 *  #if (!MeDEFINE)
 *    prototype inline functions here like this:
 *    void someFunc(void);
 *  #endif
 *
 *  #if (MeDEFINE)
 *    define inline functions here like this:
 *    MeINLINE someFunc(void)
 *    {
 *     ...
 *    }
 *
 *  Inlining can be turned off by defining MeDONTINLINE in the makefile.
