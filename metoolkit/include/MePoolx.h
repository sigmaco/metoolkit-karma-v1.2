/****************************************************************************
  The pool is YET ANOTHER container for managing bits of memory.  
  It is similar to a pool, but the advantage of a pool is that it 
  does not allocate any memory, unless you want it to.  You can allocate
  your own chunk of memory (e.g. with _alloca) and then init a
  pool to manage it for you.  The pool uses an "int" in the
  beginning of each UNUSED record for the free-list, therefore the recsize
  must be at least sizeof(int).

  The performance of MePoolx is O(1) for all operations.

  To use it:

    void foo()
    {
        MePoolx p;
        MeVector3 m[500];

        MePoolxInit(&p, m, sizeof *m, 500);    // initialize pool
        MeVector3* v = (MeVector3*) MePoolxGet(&r);   // allocate one item
        MePoolxPut(&p, v);     // deallocate one item
    }

  Implementation notes:

  The pool uses a lazy memory management scheme.  Basically, when you 
  call init, it is assumed that all the records are free.  The "free" is set
  to the first record and -1 is stored there.  As you get/put records, a
  linked list of free records is maintained, starting at the "free" index
  and the last item in the list is always the top of the "never been used"
  chunk of the memory.  The last item is always marked with a -1.
